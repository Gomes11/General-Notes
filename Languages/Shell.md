### Shell Script

## Notes from experience
1) Shell script files are recognized by the operating system as such by the the mark '#! /bin/sh'. This specifies the usage of the most basic shell interpreter in the operating system.
2) Shell is a scripting language, thus there are no compilers available by default for it. The act of 'debugging' shell script files consists in following the flux of data and/or print (a.k.a. echo/puts) commands that are executed at runtime and produce their output as re execute the sript itself.
3) Shell works as any other scripting language such as python, tcl, ruby, etc, the major difference is that most of linux tools are written either in C or in shell, which makes it much easier to communicate with the operating system.
